# svndump2git
by Morgan Aldridge <morgant@makkintosshu.com>

## OVERVIEW

`svndump2git` is a quick wrapper around `gunzip`/`bunzip2`, `svnadmin`, and [`svn2git`](https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git) which automates the process of converting an svn backup file generated with [`svnadmin dump`](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.ref.svnadmin.c.dump.html) into a new git repository. I had to do this for a bunch of Subversion repos, so tossed this together.

## USAGE

There is only one required parameter: the file generated by `svnadmin dump`, optionally compressed with `gzip` or `bzip2` and having a `.gz` or `.bz2` file extension, respectively. Like `svn2git`, it will make the current working directory into a the new git repo, so make sure you create and change to the new directory first:

    mkdir repo
    cd repo
    svndump2git path/to/dump.svn.gz
